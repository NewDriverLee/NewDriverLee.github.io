Resear Interests
======
In genenral, I'm intereted in hardware architecture design for domain-specific computing.

* **Error correction codes and their hardware architecture design** (previous)
  
  I have a certain research background in both **LDPC** codes and **polar** codes. I specialized in algebraic codes, such as **RS** codes, **BCH** codes, and their concantenated codes.
* **Stochastic computing** (previous)

  As a new computing paradigm, stochastic computing has its advantages when compared with conventional binary computing, with **low-complexity** arithmetic units and **fault tolerance** being the most prominent ones.
* **Hardware architecture design for deep learning** (current)

  Research on hardware acceleration for deep learning includes topics such as **quantization**, **arithmetic units**, **accelerator hardware architectures**, and more. The involved models encompass **convolutional convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.
