Resear Interests
------
In general, I'm interested in hardware architecture design for domain-specific computing.

* **Error correction codes and their hardware architecture design** (previous)
  
  I have a certain research background in both **LDPC** codes and **polar** codes. I specialized in algebraic codes, such as **RS** codes, **BCH** codes, and their concatenated codes.
* **Stochastic computing** (previous)

  As a new computing paradigm, stochastic computing has its advantages when compared with conventional binary computing, with *low-complexity arithmetic units* and *fault tolerance* being the most prominent ones.
* **Hardware acceleration for deep learning** (current)

  Related topics include *quantization*, *arithmetic units*, *accelerator hardware architectures*, and more. The involved models encompass **convolutional convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.
